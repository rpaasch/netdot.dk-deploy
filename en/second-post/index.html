    <meta name="description" content="New Horizons with VR4VIP
In the VR4VIP project (Virtual Reality for Visually Impaired People), we are exploring how Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) can be used in rehabilitation and education of people with visual impairments.
While many initially think that VR is primarily a visual technology, our research shows that the immersive properties of VR can be utilized in surprising ways for people with impaired vision:
Innovative Applications

Enhanced viewing: For people with low vision, VR headsets can enhance contrasts, colors, and magnify objects
3D soundscapes: Spatial audio can be used for orientation and mobility training in safe, virtual environments
Haptic feedback: Combining VR with haptic controllers provides tactile feedback that can compensate for impaired vision
AR as vision support: Augmented Reality can highlight edges, doors, and obstacles in the real world

The technology is developing rapidly, and we are on the threshold of an exciting new era where digital tools can create unprecedented opportunities for people with visual impairments.">
