As project manager on the Erasmus&#43; project T4VIS-In3D (Trainers for visually impaired students introduce 3D printing), I worked with international partners to develop innovative tactile learning materials for the blind and visually impaired.
Traditional tactile materials have often been limited to simple 2D representations. With 3D printing, we can now create detailed models that add a whole new dimension to teaching. It gives people with visual impairments the opportunity to &ldquo;see&rdquo; complex concepts through touch.">

<p>As project manager on the Erasmus+ project T4VIS-In3D (Trainers for visually impaired students introduce 3D printing), I worked with international partners to develop innovative tactile learning materials for the blind and visually impaired.</p>
<p>Traditional tactile materials have often been limited to simple 2D representations. With 3D printing, we can now create detailed models that add a whole new dimension to teaching. It gives people with visual impairments the opportunity to &ldquo;see&rdquo; complex concepts through touch.</p>
<h3 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h3>
<p>Our project has developed methodologies and guidelines for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anatomical models for biology education</li>
<li>Architectural models for orientation training</li>
<li>Mathematical figures and shapes</li>
<li>Geographic landscapes and maps</li>
</ul>
<p>The technology opens doors for inclusion in an unprecedented way. The exciting thing about this work is seeing how a technical tool like 3D printing can bridge the gap between sighted and non-sighted people&rsquo;s experience of the world.</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring this field further in the coming years, as the technology becomes more accessible and the possibilities for application increase.</p>
