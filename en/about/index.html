I am a specialist in digital technologies with a particular focus on accessibility, education, and leadership. With a background as a teacher and deep technical insight, I combine pedagogy and technology in my work.
Professional Background

I have previously been a project manager on international Erasmus&#43; projects on tactile 3D-printed teaching materials and Virtual Reality for the visually impaired.">
